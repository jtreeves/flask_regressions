    <p>
        Here are some explanations of mathematical concepts relevant to the output from the API. Learn how to use the API to create equations, what correlation means, and which types of points reveal which types of information.
    </p>

    <h3>Equations</h3>

    <p>
        All functions can be created by using the numbers provided in the coefficients array. For example, if the <code>linear_coefficients</code> array is <code>[7.64, 3.41]</code>, then that means the <code>a</code> value of the linear equation is 7.64 and the <code>b</code> value of the linear equation is 3.41.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Linear</h4>
            <p>
                Straight line with a constant slope and a single x-intercept; best suited to situations with constant growth
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{x} + b
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Quadratic</h4>
            <p>
                Parabola with either a maximum or a minimum; best suited to situations where you hope to maximize or minize a specific variable
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{x^2} + b\cdot{x} + c
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cubic</h4>
            <p>
                Curve with potentially both a maximum and a minimum; best suited to situations where you assume a variable can be maximized at one instance and minimized at another
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{x^3} + b\cdot{x^2} + c\cdot{x} + d
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Hyperbolic</h4>
            <p>
                Curve that approaches an asymptote; best suited to situations where you assume the output will fall to a certain value over time
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{\frac{1}{x}} + b
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Exponential</h4>
            <p>
                Curve that increases or decreases at a faster rate than any of its peers; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase or decrease rapidly and without any limits
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{b^x}
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Logarithmic</h4>
            <p>
                Curve that grows slowly; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase at a slower-than-linear rate
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{\ln{x}} + b
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Logistic</h4>
            <p>
                Curve that passes through a period of exponential growth before approaching an asymptote; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase rapidly before levelling off
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = \frac{a}{1 + \text{e}^{-b\cdot(x - c)}}
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Sinusoidal</h4>
            <p>
                Curve that oscillates back and forth between a maximum and minimum value; best suited to situations where you expect cyclical behavior
            </p>
            <p lang="latex">
                y = a\cdot{\sin(b\cdot(x - c))} + d
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Correlation</h3>

    <p>
        The correlation coefficient measures how well a model fits a data set. The closer the correlation is to 1.0, the better the fit; the closer the correlation is to 0.0, the worse the fit. There are multiple ways to calculate the correlation coefficient of a given model. This API uses the following approach:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a list of all the observed values (i.e., the y-coordinates of all the points in the data set)
            <p lang="latex">
                y_i = [ y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n ]
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a list of all the predicted values (i.e., the y-coordinates you would get for each x-coordinate if you used the created model)
            <p lang="latex">
                \hat{y}_i = [ \hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \cdots, \hat{y}_n ]
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calculate the arithmetic mean of all the observed values (i.e., the average y-coordinate from the original data set)
            <p lang="latex">
                \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\cdot{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n y_i}
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a list of all the residuals (i.e., the difference each observed value and its corresponding predicted value)
            <p lang="latex">
                e_i = [ y_1 - \hat{y}_1, y_2 - \hat{y}_2, \cdots, y_n - \hat{y}_n ]
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a list of all the deviations (i.e., the difference between each observed value and the mean value)
            <p lang="latex">
                d_i = [ y_1 - \bar{y}, y_2 - \bar{y}, \cdots, y_n - \bar{y} ]
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calcuate the sum of squares of all residuals
            <p lang="latex">
                SS_{res} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n e_i^2
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calcuate the sum of squares of all deviations
            <p lang="latex">
                SS_{dev} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n d_i^2
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calcuate the correlation coefficient by taking the square root of the difference between 1 and the ratio of the sums of squares
            <p lang="latex">
                r = \sqrt{1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{dev}}}
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
