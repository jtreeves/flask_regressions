<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        I sign up for access to the API using my email: me@email.com
    </li>

    <li>
        I note the API key that appears on my screen after I sign up: S3CR3T491K3Y
    </li>

    <li>
        I chose a source code for my collection: abc123
    </li>

    <li>
        I make a POST request
        <ul>
            <li>
                I include my API key and my source code as parameters in the URL of my request
                {% include 'snippets/get_url.html' %}
            </li>

            <li>
                I include a title, indepenent variable, dependent variable, precision, and data set as keys of an object in the body of my request
                {% include 'snippets/post_body.html' %}
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        I get a response object
        {% include 'snippets/response_object.html' %}
    </li>

    <li>
        I draw conclusions based on what I received
        <ul>
            <li>
                While the cubic model has the highest correlation coefficient, I know that total deaths from novel diseases follow a mostly logistic growth pattern; since the logistic model's correlation coefficient is 0.9756 (very close to a perfect 1.0), I feel confident in using this model to make predictions
            </li>

            <li>
                Based on the coefficients provided for the logistic model, I can create a logistic function for the data, where <code>d</code> represents the total number of deaths after <code>m</code> months have elapsed
                <p lang="latex">d(m) = \frac{564205.2863}{1 + \text{e}^{-0.3277\cdot(m - 10.4152)}}</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                Based on the array provided within the inflections section of the logistic model's points, I know the model predicts a turning point in total deaths will occur at the following point
                <p lang="latex">(10.4152, 282102.6432)</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                Using the equation I created, I predict that the total deaths by July 2021 will be 532,264
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
