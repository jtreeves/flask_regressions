<h3>Equations</h3>

<p>
    All functions can be created by using the numbers provided in the coefficients array. For example, if the <code>linear_coefficients</code> array is <code>[7.64, 3.41]</code>, then that means the <code>a</code> value of the linear equation is 7.64 and the <code>b</code> value of the linear equation is 3.41.

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Linear</h4>
        <p>
            Straight line with a constant slope and a single x-intercept; best suited to situations with constant growth
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{x} + b
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Quadratic</h4>
        <p>
            Parabola with either a maximum or a minimum; best suited to situations where you hope to maximize or minize a specific variable
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{x^2} + b\cdot{x} + c
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Cubic</h4>
        <p>
            Curve with potentially both a maximum and a minimum; best suited to situations where you assume a variable can be maximized at one instance and minimized at another
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{x^3} + b\cdot{x^2} + c\cdot{x} + d
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Hyperbolic</h4>
        <p>
            Curve that approaches an asymptote; best suited to situations where you assume the output will fall to a certain value over time
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{\frac{1}{x}} + b
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Exponential</h4>
        <p>
            Curve that increases or decreases at a faster rate than any of its peers; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase or decrease rapidly and without any limits
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{b^x}
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Logarithmic</h4>
        <p>
            Curve that grows slowly; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase at a slower-than-linear rate
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{\ln{x}} + b
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Logistic</h4>
        <p>
            Curve that passes through a period of exponential growth before approaching an asymptote; best suited to situations where you assume the output will increase rapidly before levelling off
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = \frac{a}{1 + \text{e}^{-b\cdot(x - c)}}
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Sinusoidal</h4>
        <p>
            Curve that oscillates back and forth between a maximum and minimum value; best suited to situations where you expect cyclical behavior
        </p>
        <p lang="latex">
            y = a\cdot{\sin(b\cdot(x - c))} + d
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
